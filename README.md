TASK 1:

This project is a **Temperature Converter** program designed to convert temperatures between Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), and Kelvin (K). It includes functions for each possible conversion, such as Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Kelvin, and Kelvin to Celsius, ensuring full flexibility. The user inputs a temperature value and its unit (C, F, or K), and the program calculates the equivalent temperatures in the other two units, displaying the results in a formatted output. If the user provides invalid input, such as a non-numeric value or an unrecognized unit, the program gracefully handles the error with an appropriate message. This project showcases Python programming fundamentals, including functions, conditionals, and error handling, while providing practical utility for temperature conversions in a user-friendly way.

TASK 2:

This project is a simple Python game called "Guess the Number." The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The player inputs their guess, and the game gives feedback whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. It continues until the player guesses the number correctly. The game also counts and displays the number of attempts made. It ensures that the input is a valid integer and prompts the player to try again if an invalid input is entered.

TASK 3:

This project is a simple Contact Management System built in Python. It allows the user to add, view, edit, and delete contacts, which consist of a name, phone number, and email address. The contacts are stored in a JSON file so that they persist even after the program ends. The user interacts with the system through a menu where they can choose different actions. The system ensures that the contacts are saved to the file after every modification. This project helps in managing personal contacts efficiently while maintaining data integrity using file storage.

TASK 4:

This project is a Python implementation of a Sudoku solver. The program solves a given 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. It first checks if a number can be placed in a particular position by ensuring that it doesnâ€™t conflict with existing numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid. The `solve_sudoku` function tries different numbers for each empty cell (denoted by 0) and recursively attempts to complete the board. If a solution is found, it prints the solved Sudoku board; otherwise, it indicates that no solution exists. The puzzle is provided as an initial 2D list, and the program outputs the solved grid if possible.

TASK 5:

This project is a web scraping tool built in Python that extracts product information from an e-commerce website. It uses the `requests` library to fetch the webpage and `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` to parse the HTML content. The program looks for specific product details like name, price, and rating, and collects them from the first 10 products on the page. The data is then saved to a CSV file with the columns "Name", "Price", and "Rating". The `scrape_products` function handles the entire process, and the data is stored in a file called "products.csv". This project automates data collection from an online store for analysis or further use.
